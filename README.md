# PVOCAL (Predictions of Volitile Organic Compounds in the atmosphere using machine Learning) Model

This model was initially created as my final project for the 2023 west cohort of the NASA Student Airborne Research Program. This program is an 8 week research internship where students are able to participate
  dircetly in NASA Airborne Science and do hands on reseach at the University of California Irvine. 

If you are a NASA SARP intern and are interested in working and expanding upon this model within the context of SARP please message me on GitHub and I'd be happy to explain elements of this model in detail!

## About

The purpose of this project is to explore the intersection between meteorology and atmospheric chemistry. This project is in cooperation with NASA's Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative!

The PVOCAL model uses meteorological variables calculated at the endpoints of backwards trajectories generated by the NOAA HYSPLIT model as inputs to make predictions about airborne VOC concentrations
  using Sci-Kit Learn's Random Forest Regression algorithm.
